Well-Structured Paragraphs:

Site Contamination
------------------

* No land contamination data are available in Council's regulatory records.

Wind Zones
----------

* Wind Zone(s) for this property: High wind speed of 44 m/s.
* The wind zones are based on wind speed data specific to all building sites as outlined in NZS 3604:2011. Other factors such as topographic classes, site exposure and ground roughness determine the actual wind bracing demands and bracing elements required for the building.
* For further information refer to NZS 3604:2011 Section 5 — Bracing Design.

Soil Issues
--------------

* The Auckland Council is not aware of any soil issues in relation to this land. If any soil information/reports have been prepared in relation to this property, they will be available for viewing at an Auckland Council Service Centre or via the property file product services.

Flooding
----------

* This statement entitled "Flooding" appears on all LIMs.
* Known flooding information is displayed on the map attached to this LIM entitled “Special Land Features – Natural Hazards - Flooding”.
* The information shown in the “Special Land Features - Natural Hazards - Flooding” map is also shown on the Auckland Council online map viewer (Geomaps), at [www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz](http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz), which is updated from time to time.
* Any proposed development may require a flooding assessment to be provided by the applicant.
* The absence of flooding on the “Special Land Features - Natural Hazards - Flooding” map does not exclude the possibility of the site flooding, particularly from Overland Flow Paths which may be on other properties. For further details please check Flood Viewer.

Exposure Zones
--------------

* New Zealand Standard 3604:2011 classifies all properties in New Zealand into zones based on environmental features including wind, earthquake, snow load and exposure. These zones are relevant to building requirements, such as strength of buildings, materials that should be used and maintenance. All building sites are classified as being in Exposure Zones Extreme Sea Spray, B, C, or D, depending on the severity of exposure to wind-blown sea-spray salt.
* This property is classified as: Zone D. Within each of the zones there are different environmental locations that require fittings and fixtures appropriate to its designation as outlined Tables 4.1 to 4.3 in NZS 3604:2011 being either "closed", "sheltered" or "exposed".
* For further information refer to NZS 3604:2011 Section 4 — Durability.

Coastal Erosion
--------------

* This explanation appears on all LIMs, not just sites that may be susceptible to coastal erosion.
* The map entitled “Natural Hazards - Coastal Erosion” shows information on potential coastal erosion and resulting land instability, if any, in relation to this site.
* Coastal erosion is the wearing away of land due to coastal processes such as waves and currents. Coastal instability is the movement of land (typically as a landslide) resulting from the loss of support caused by coastal erosion.

## Part 3


Well-structured Paragraph:
The map shows lines that indicate areas susceptible to coastal instability and erosion (ASCIE) within the next 100 years based on projected sea level rise scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The lines represent three timescales and take into account carbon emission scenarios, such as RCP8.5 and RCP8.5+. These projections align with related sea level rise values from the Ministry for the Environment's Coastal Hazards and Climate Change Guidance for Local Government.

Coherent Summary:
The map shows areas susceptible to coastal instability and erosion within the next 100 years based on projected sea level rise scenarios from RCP8.5 and RCP8.5+. These lines represent three timescales and align with related sea level rise values from the Ministry for the Environment's Coastal Hazards and Climate Change Guidance for Local Government.

Meaningful Insights:
The map provides information on areas susceptible to coastal instability and erosion within the next 100 years based on projected sea level rise scenarios from RCP8.5 and RCP8.5+. This information aligns with related sea level rise values from the Ministry for the Environment's Coastal Hazards and Climate Change Guidance for Local Government. The map also shows development on sites affected by potential coastal erosion may be subject to Auckland Unitary Plan activity controls and may require a detailed coastal hazard assessment report to be completed by a qualified expert. This information is relevant to developers who are considering building in areas susceptible to coastal instability and erosion within the next 100 years.

Those parts of the Auckland Unitary Plan that are operative replace the corresponding parts of legacy regional and district plans. However, certain parts of the AUP:OP are the subject of appeals and have not become operative. If a property is subject to an appeal this will be identified on the attached Unitary Plan Property Summary Report. Where this is the case, both the Auckland Unitary Plan Decisions version and the legacy regional and district plans will need to be considered.

Coherent Summaries:
There are several important points to note when considering the permit information regarding a specific property in question. 
Firstly, there are two permits issued prior to the Building Act 1991 taking effect and there is no record of a compliance schedule for this particular property/building. It is recommended that the Council property file be viewed and compared with the actual building and activities on site to identify any illegal or unauthorised building works or activities.
Additionally, there are also no current licences recorded on this property. Furthermore, there is no information notified under Section 124 of the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services Act 2006 relating to this specific property/building. However, Purchasers or those intending to develop the land should satisfy themselves that the land is suitable for any intended use or future development proposal.

If a property is subject to an appeal, both the Auckland Unitary Plan Decisions version and the legacy regional and district plans will need to be considered. 

Meaningful Insights:
The permit information regarding the specific property in question provides some important insights.  It highlights that there are two permits issued prior to the Building Act 1991 taking effect and there is no record of a compliance schedule for this particular property/building.
