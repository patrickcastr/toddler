This information should not be regarded as a full analysis of the site features of this land, as there may be 
features that the Council is unaware of.  The applicant is solely responsible for ensuring that the land is 
suitable for a particular purpose including development.
Site Contamination
No land contamination data are available in Council's regulatory records.
Wind Zones
Wind Zone(s) for this property: High wind speed of 44 m/s 
                
The wind zones are based on wind speed data specific to all building sites as outlined in NZS 3604:2011. 
Other factors such as topographic classes, site exposure and ground roughness determine the actual wind 
bracing demands and bracing elements required for the building.  
For further information refer to NZS 3604:2011 Section 5 — Bracing Design
Soil Issues
The Auckland Council is not aware of any soil issues in relation to this land.  If any soil information/reports 
have been prepared in relation to this property, they will be available for viewing at an Auckland Council 
Service Centre or via the property file product services.
Flooding   
  
This statement entitled "Flooding" appears on all LIMs. 
  
Known flooding information is displayed on the map attached to this LIM entitled “Special Land Features – 
Natural Hazards - Flooding”. 
  
The information shown in the “Special Land Features - Natural Hazards - Flooding” map is also shown on the 
Auckland Council online map viewer (Geomaps), at www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz , which is updated from 
time to time. 
  
Any proposed development may require a flooding assessment to be provided by the applicant. 
  
The absence of flooding on the “Special Land Features - Natural Hazards - Flooding” map does not exclude 
the possibility of the site flooding, particularly from Overland Flow Paths which may be on other properties. 
  
 For further details please check Flood Viewer
Exposure Zones
New Zealand Standard 3604:2011 classifies all properties in New Zealand into zones based on 
environmental features including wind, earthquake, snow load and exposure.  These zones are relevant to 
building requirements, such as strength of buildings, materials that should be used and maintenance. 
All building sites are classified as being in Exposure Zones Extreme Sea Spray, B, C, or D, depending on the 
severity of exposure to wind driven salt.
This property is classified as: Zone D
--- Page 4 ---
Page 3 Auckland Council (09) 301 0101 or enquiries@aucklandcouncil.govt.nz 8270596587LIM 29/04/2025High — Coastal areas with high risk of wind-blown sea-spray salt deposits. This is defined as within 500m of 
the sea including harbours, or 100m from tidal estuaries and sheltered inlets. The coastal area also includes 
all offshore islands including Waiheke Island, Great Barrier Island. Within each of the zones there are 
different environmental locations that require fittings and fixtures appropriate to its designation as outlined 
Tables 4.1 to 4.3 in NZS 3604:2011 being either "closed", "sheltered" or "exposed".  
For further information refer to NZS 3604:2011 Section 4 — Durability.
Coastal Erosion   
  
This explanation appears on all LIMs, not just sites that may be susceptible to coastal erosion.  
  
The map entitled “Natural Hazards - Coastal Erosion” shows information on potential coastal erosion and 
resulting land instability, if any, in relation to this site. 
  
Coastal erosion is the wearing away of land due to coastal processes such as waves and currents. Coastal 
instability is the movement of land (typically as a landslide) resulting from the loss of support caused by 
coastal erosion. 
  
Where applicable, the map shows lines that indicate areas susceptible to coastal instability and erosion 
(ASCIE) within the next 100 years. The lines do not show the future position of the coast. Rather, they show 
the landward edge of the area that might become unstable as a result of coastal erosion. The area between 
this line and the sea is considered to be potentially susceptible to erosion, or instability caused by erosion. 
  
The lines represent three timescales, and take into account projected sea level rise based on carbon 
emission scenarios known as representative concentration pathways (RCP): 
  
• 2050 (0.28 m of sea level rise; RCP 8.5) 
• 2080 (0.55 m of sea level rise; RCP 8.5) 
• 2130 (1.18 m of sea level rise; RCP 8.5) 
• 2130 (1.52 m of sea level rise; RCP 8.5+) 
  
The RCP projections are from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fifth assessment report 
(2015), and the related sea level rise values align with Ministry for the Environment Coastal Hazards and 
Climate Change Guidance for Local Government (2017). 
  
The lines are based on data from a regional study (“Predicting Auckland’s Exposure to Coastal Instability and 
Erosion”, available on the Council website).  The lines may not take into account local variability, and are not 
intended for site-specific use. 
  
Development on sites affected by potential coastal erosion may be subject to Auckland Unitary Plan activity 
controls and may require a detailed coastal hazard assessment report to be completed by a qualified expert. 
 
s44A(2)(b) Information on private and public stormwater and sewerage drains
Information on private and public stormwater and sewerage drains is shown on the underground services 
map attached. 
Note: Private drainage is the responsibility of the land owner up to and including the point of connection to 
the public sewer or drain.
